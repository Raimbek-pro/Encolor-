after deadline:
my project has a most comfortable unique built in color  picker so with simple but organic design(color adding done by javascrpit) (using Helvetica font) . I used advanced methods of web development that include URL dispatcher,views (Python functions or classes that receive web requests and return web responses), templates (with web pages). I used this unique approach to reach the oppurtunity to easily extend the project in the future) . I compromised the interface feautures of other levels because it wouldnt make sense as built-in color picker perfectly deals with setting up hue ,saturation, lightness .
